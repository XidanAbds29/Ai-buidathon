## 📢 Executive Summary
We have built a working prototype of a **Credit Scoring Engine** that does *not* require a bank account or credit card history. Instead, it uses **mobile wallet behavior** (bKash/Nagad), **telecom usage** (top-ups), and a novel **Social Trust Score** to assess creditworthiness. This system provides Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) with a risk assessment tool that is both **predictive** and **explainable**.

**Mission**: To reduce the loan processing time from **5 days to 5 seconds** and increase financial inclusion by **50%**.

---

## 🚩 The Problem
Traditional credit scoring models (FICO, CIB) rely on formal financial history.
*   **100 Million** Bangladeshis are unbanked.
*   **SMEs** struggle to get capital because they run on cash/mobile money.
*   **No Data = No Loan.** This creates a poverty trap.

---

## 💡 The Solution
We treat **Digital Behavior** as **Financial History**.
Our engine ingests unstructured activity data and converts it into a structured **Credit Score (300-900)**.

### Core Pillars
1.  **Alternative Data**: Mobile top-ups indicate cash flow stability.
2.  **Social Capital**: In rural areas, a person's reputation is their collateral. We digitize this.
3.  **Transparency**: Using SHAP to tell the user *exactly* why they were rejected and how to improve.

---

## 🦄 Key Innovation: TrustGraph™ AI
**The "10x" Feature that sets us apart.**

Most AI models look at *individuals* in isolation. **TrustGraph™** looks at the *community*.
We build a graph network of borrowers.
*   **Logic**: If User A has a good repayment history, and User A refers User B, then User B inherits a "Trust Score Boost".
*   **Implementation**: A recursive algorithm that propagates "Trust Credits" through verified social edges.
*   **Impact**: Enables lending to "Cold Start" users (e.g., a housewife with no phone history but a strong community reputation).

## 🏗 System Architecture

The application follows a **Microservices-ready Monorepo** architecture.

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Core

### Model Selection
We chose **Random Forest Regressor** over Deep Learning (Neural Networks) for Version 1 because:
1.  **Tabular Data Performance**: Tree-based models outperform Neural Networks on structured financial data.
2.  **Interpretability**: It is easier to explain than a "Black Box" Neural Network.
3.  **Robustness**: Handles outliers and non-linear relationships better than Logistic Regression.

### Feature Engineering
The model transforms raw data into these weighted features:
*   `wallet_balance` (30% weight): Liquidity proxy.
*   `avg_monthly_topup` (20% weight): Consistency proxy.
*   `community_trust_referrals` (30% weight): **TrustGraph** signal.
*   `transaction_count` (10% weight): Velocity proxy.

### Explainability (XAI)
We use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**.
*   Every prediction generates a set of SHAP values.
*   Example: A score of 750 might be:
    *   Base Score: 500
    *   \+ 100 (High Top-up)
    *   \+ 150 (TrustGraph Boost)
*   These values are converted into natural language sentences for the Dashboard.

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Backend (FastAPI)
*   **Performance**: Uses `uvicorn` (ASGI) for asynchronous request handling.
*   **Type Safety**: Uses Pydantic models to validate all incoming data.
*   **Hot-Loading**: AI Model is loaded into memory once at startup (`joblib.load`) to ensure sub-100ms response times.

### Frontend (Next.js)
*   **Stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Components**:
    *   `ScoreCard`: Visual gauge for the credit score.
    *   `VoiceAssistant`: A simulated conversational agent (using Web Speech API concepts) to demonstrate accessibility.
*   **Design**: Clean, "FinTech Premium" aesthetic with glassmorphism effects.

## 🛡️ Compliance & Security Framework

Our architecture is built "Privacy-First" to meet global and local regulatory standards.

### 1. ISO 27001 (Information Security)
*   **Data Encryption**: All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
*   **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures only authorized MFI officers can view full credit reports.

### 2. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
*   **Right to Explain**: Our **SHAP-based Explainability** fulfills the requirement for "Meaningful Information about the Logic involved" in automated decision-making (Article 22).
*   **Data Minimization**: We only process the specific meta-data fields required for scoring, not raw message contents or voice logs.
*   **Consent Management**: Explicit opt-in required via the Borrowers App before accessing Telco/MFS data.

### 3. BFIU (Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit)
*   **KYC Integration**: The "One-Click Apply" verifies identity against the porichoy.gov.bd (NID) database.
*   **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: The **Fraud Detection Graph** actively monitors for circular transactions and "smurfing" patterns typical of money laundering.
*   **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs of all credit decisions are maintained for regulatory inspection.
